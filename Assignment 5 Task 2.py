# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Create list from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Extract first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Reverse extracted elements
reversed_list = first_five[::-1]

# Print results
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Extracted first five elements:", first_five)
print("Reversed extracted elements:", reversed_list)
